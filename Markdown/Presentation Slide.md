# Introduction: Smart Computing for a Greener Planet

**Our Motivation:** AI is growing fast, and so is its energy use. We need to make it smarter and greener.
- **Save Money:** Use electricity when it's cheapest.
- **Help the Planet:** Use energy when it comes from clean sources, like solar and wind.

**Our Goal:** To predict the best time to run big computing tasks.

**How do we do it?**
- We built an AI that forecasts the next 72 hours of a country's energy grid.
- This gives us a simple signal: "when" the grid is greenest.

**The Big Idea: Run when clean, pause when dirty.**
Instead of running AI training anytime, we schedule it for the cleanest, cheapest hours.
